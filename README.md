# GoT-dimension-reduction

Submission to Siraj Raval's competition ["Visualize a Game of Thrones Dataset"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQsOFWqpjkE
)

> The challenge for this video is to visualize [this](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones) Game of Thrones dataset. Use T-SNE to lower the dimensionality of the data  and plot it using matplotlib. In your README, write our 2-3 sentences of something you discovered about the data after   visualizing it. This will be great practice in understanding why dimensionality reduction is so important and analyzing data  visually.

## Usage
